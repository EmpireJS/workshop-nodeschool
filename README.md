[nodeschool.io](nodeschool.io) is a community driven, open source educational software that teaches various Node.js and JavaScript skills in an interactive, self-guided format. At EmpireNode, we'll be offering workshops for every skill level -- from Node beginners to a more seasoned challenge.

This set of [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io) workshops include:

- [Learn You Node!](http://nodeschool.io/#learn-you-node)
"Learn the basics of node: asynchronous i/o, http"

- [ByteWiser](https://github.com/maxogden/bytewiser)
"Learn how to manipulate binary data in node.js and HTML5 browsers."

- [Level Me Up Scotty!](http://nodeschool.io/#levelmeup)
"Learn to use leveldb, a simple key/value store with a vibrant package ecosystem"

We'll also be offering a unique opportunity to work on returning the favor to our friends at nodeschool by contributing! We'll have mentors on hand while you help fix bugs, [answer questions](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions#discussions) to others who have attempted workshoppers, or [create your own](http://nodeschool.io/building-workshops.html).

These workshoppers will run concurrently and time is limited, so you'll most likely get through just one this event.
